  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores the motion-planning problem
	for multiple moving objects. The approach taken consists of assigning
	priorities to the objects, then planning motions one object at a
	time. For each moving object, the planner constructs a configuration
	space-time that represents the time-varying constraints imposed on
	the moving object by the other moving and stationary objects. The
	planner represents this space-time approximately, using two-dimensional
	slices. The space-time is then searched for a collision-free path.
	The paper demonstrates this approach in two domains. One domain consists
	of translating planar objects; the other domain consists of two-link
	planar articulated arms.},
