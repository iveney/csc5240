\frametitle {Conclusion and future work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Empirical hardness model is valuable for the study of empirical behavior of complex algorithm
  \item Future work:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Apply empirical hardness model to stochastic search algorithm
        \item Build stronger structural/hierachical model
        \item Study how some features cause instance to be hard or easy for certain types of algorithms
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
